# LoadTester
The intention is to create a console application which allows for load testing.

The primary goal is for me to learn a few new topics and libraries with .NET 6.

## Getting started


Packages I would like to learn and use for goal:
- [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api)
- [FluentValidation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation)
- [Flurl](https://flurl.dev/)
